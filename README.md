# 🤒 Patient-database
# 🏫 My school project focused on developing a comprehensive patient database management system, a sophisticated yet user-friendly application designed to streamline the process of managing patient information within a healthcare setting.
# 📢 This system encompasses an array of critical features, including login and logout functionalities, patient and user databases, new patient registration, user registration, password resetting, and an informative welcome page that shows only the users patients and not others.
# 🤟🏻 I used SQL, PHP, JavaScript, HTML and CSS for this project.
# 🗒️ Note: This doesn't work without a database. I have included the .sql database that works with this version. You just need to start Apache and make a new database named "potilastietokanta". Insert to potilastietokanta.sql file there.
